# cloudscribe.Entropy

Miscellaneous customization and/or additional features for the [cloudscribe](https://www.cloudscribe.com) ecosystem.

a repository to share reusable bits of common functionality so I don't have to re-build it for each of my client projects.

some of the class library projects here will also be published on Nuget.org
